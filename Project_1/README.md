# Linear Regression: Exam Score Prediction using PyTorch

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a linear regression model using PyTorch to predict exam scores based on the number of study hours. The dataset used for this project contains two attributes: hours of study and exam scores.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of the following attributes:

1. **Hours of Study:** The number of hours a student studies.
2. **Exam Score:** The score achieved by the student in the exam.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading:** The dataset is loaded into the PyTorch environment.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Any necessary preprocessing steps, such as normalization or handling missing values, are performed on the data.
3. **Model Definition:** A linear regression model is defined using PyTorch.
4. **Model Training:** The model is trained using the training data to learn the relationship between study hours and exam scores.
5. **Model Evaluation:** The performance of the trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE)
6. **Prediction:** The trained model is used to make predictions on new instances of study hours to estimate the exam scores.

## Usage
To use this project:

1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries, including PyTorch.
2. Clone the repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file `Linear_Regression_Exam_Score_Prediction.ipynb`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells to run the code.
4. Explore the code, data, and results of the analysis.
5. Modify the code as needed to experiment with different models or techniques.
