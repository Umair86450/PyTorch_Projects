# Linear Regression: Tips Prediction based on Restaurant Data

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a linear regression model to predict the amount of tips a restaurant server can expect to receive based on various factors such as total bill amount and tips. The dataset used in this project contains attributes related to restaurant transactions and tip amounts.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

- **Total Bill Amount:** The total amount of the bill, including tax and excluding tips.
- **Tips:** The amount of tip received by the server.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data Loading:** The dataset is loaded into the PyTorch environment.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Any necessary preprocessing steps, such as normalization or handling missing values, are performed on the data.
3. **Model Definition:** A linear regression model is defined using PyTorch.
4. **Model Training:** The linear regression model is trained using the features to predict the tip amount.
5. **Model Evaluation:** The performance of the trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) .
6. **Prediction:** The trained model can be used to make tip predictions for new instances of restaurant transactions.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn) installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file `Linear_Regression_Tips_Prediction.ipynb`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to execute the code.
4. Explore the code, the data, and the results of the analysis.
5. Modify the code as needed to experiment with different approaches or to apply the model to new data.

## Credits
This project was inspired by the classic dataset provided by the Seaborn library, which contains information about tips in a restaurant.
