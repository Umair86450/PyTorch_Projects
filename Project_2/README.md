# Linear Regression: Salary Prediction based on Experience

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a linear regression model to predict the salary of an individual based on their work experience. The dataset used in this project contains two attributes: experience and salary.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

- **Experience:** The work experience of an individual in years.
- **Salary:** The annual salary of an individual in dollars.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data Loading:** The dataset is loaded into the PyTorch environment.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Any necessary preprocessing steps, such as normalization or handling missing values, are performed on the data.
3. **Model Definition:** A linear regression model is defined using PyTorch.
4. **Model Training:** A linear regression model is trained using the experience feature to predict the salary.
5. **Model Evaluation:** The performance of the trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as  Mean Squared Error (MSE)
6. **Prediction:** The trained model can be used to make salary predictions for new instances of experience.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn) installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file `Linear_Regression_Experience_of_Salary_prediction.ipynb`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to execute the code.
4. Explore the code, the data, and the results of the analysis.
5. Modify the code as needed to experiment with different approaches or to apply the model to new data.
